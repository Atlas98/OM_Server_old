# OM_Server_old
C daemon application to interface php to my library through socket connections

Doesn't compile on windows (I designed it for Linux servers, thus compiles on Linux)
Doesn't work standalone because it needs the main library it's designed for

also, incomplete, and it became a lot more complex than I was expecting, so i'll drop it for a quicker solution.
